A photon is massless. 0 mass
The size of a quark is 10^-18
Color charge is a property of quarks and gluons and in the quantum chromodynamics while electrical charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field.
Bosons are any particle with multiple versions of itself in the same quantum state while Fermions are partices that can only have one state(spin).
Particles in both a Boson and Hadron are made up of Quarks. e.g Mesons
The purose of a bubble chamber is to make the tracks of ionizing particles visible as a row of bubbles in a liquid.
Leptons are elementary particles and they do not appear to be made up of smaller unots of matter.
Two types Leptons: Electron, Neutrino. Two types of Baryons: Nucleon, Hyperon.

Particles that help in the exchange magnetic force between two charged particles.
